# PunchForceMeter
A project based on Arduino to find the force of a punch in real-time using a MPU6050. This system is programmed to calculate force using acceleration data and integrates velocity for improved accuracy. This project is inspired from the tamil movie "Vikram" which showcases a smart watch that can measure the force of a punch.
